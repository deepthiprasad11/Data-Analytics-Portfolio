# Exploratory Data Analysis on Online Sales Data

*Tools:* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an online sales dataset to understand overall sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. 
The focus is on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data to uncover meaningful patterns before building any models.

## Key tasks
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) for initial data preview and cleaning.
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis, including summary statistics and distribution plots for key variables such as revenue, quantity, discounts, and categories.
- Created visualizations with Matplotlib to identify trends, outliers, and relationships between features like sales vs. time, product categories, and customer segments.
