# SQL Analytics Case Studies

*Tools:* SQL (CTE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, aggregate and window functions)

This folder contains multiple SQL case studies focused on practicing analytical query writing and solving realistic business problems. Each mini‑project showcases how to transform raw relational data into meaningful insights using core and advanced SQL features.

## Case studies included
- *E‑commerce user behavior and recommendation* – Queries to analyze user activity, product views, purchases, and recommend products based on past behavior.
- *Luxury loan portfolio analysis* – SQL analysis of loan applications, approvals, risk levels, and repayment status.
- *Employee management system* – Queries for employee records, departments, salaries, and performance‑related metrics.
- *Disease diagnosis analysis* – Analysis of patients diagnosed with a particular disease, including counts, trends, and risk segments.

## What this project demonstrates
- Use of SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, and joins across multiple tables.
- Use of CTEs and nested queries to structure complex business logic.
- Creation of reusable analytical queries for reporting and decision‑making.
